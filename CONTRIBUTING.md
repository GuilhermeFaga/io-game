## Pull Request Guide
#### Steps before creating a pull request.

1. If you're `x` commits behind and you think your pull request might have conflicts with the master, catch up with `git pull https://github.com/valkyrienyanko/io-game.git master` and resolve them.
2. Use `linter` and `linter:fix` to make sure your following the global linter rules.
3. Always test the application to see if it works as intended with no additional bugs you may be adding!
4. Create the pull request.
5. State all the changes you made in the PR, not everyone will understand what you've done!
