## Setup

1. Clone `https://github.com/valkyrienyanko/io-game-v2.git`.
2. Download and install `LTS` [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
3. Run `install-dependencies.cmd`. You will need express and socket.io, electron and nodemon are optional. If you choose not to use nodemon you will have to modify all the scripts to change from `nodemon` to `node`.
4. Start server with `start-server.cmd`.
5. Create a client by opening up `https://localhost:7777/` in your browser.

If you're using nodemon, the server will automatically restart whenever code has been changed. If you ever need to restart the server manually you can do so with the `rs` command.
