### Setup

1. Clone `https://github.com/valkyrienyanko/io-game-v2.git`.
2. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). (Recommended version)
3. Run `install-dependencies.bat`.
4. Start server with `start-server.bat`.
5. Create a client by opening up `https://localhost:7777/` in your browser.

The server will automatically restart whenever code has been changed. If you ever need to restart the server manually you can do so with the `rs` command. If you do not want the server to auto restart you can edit the `start-server.bat` to say `node server.js` instead of `nodemon server.js`.
